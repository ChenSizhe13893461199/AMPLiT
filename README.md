# AMPLiT

### The framework of AMPLiT:
![](Framework.png)
The source codes of the AMPLiT are available here, with an average **AUPRC indicator of 0.9486±0.0003** and a significantly reduced training time of **3200±53s** on the normal laptop (Intel i7-10875H CPU). Compared to the previous model AMPidentifier 1.0 (**AUPRC: 0.9495±0.0022**, **training time: 15,374±169s**), with overall fitting parameters and time costs decreased by approximately 56% and 80%, respectively. With the introduction of three computational modules, it still showed high overall prediction performance and low false-positive conditions (**Specificity: 90.1347±0.9487%**, **Sensitivity: 99.6864±0.046%**).

### Details of Using AMPLiT
### Requirements

- numpy==1.23.5
- sklearn=1.2.0
- propy3=1.1.0

## General utilization guidance:

**1.** The deployment codes can be found in "Train_AMP_identifier2.py", with full details and annotations attached. Firstly, open "Train_AMP_identifier2.py" on your laptop (e.g. by Spyder) and introduce all the necessary packages aforementioned.

**2.** Prepare the necessary dataset (training dataset, validation dataset, and test dataset), and their descriptors. For more details, please refer to the section of **Implementation details** below.

**3.** Following the codes provided in "Train_AMP_identifier2.py" and running it in your local Spyder or other suitable environment directly, the training of AMPLiT will be smoothly performed.

## Implementation details:

**1.** The training sequences were deposited in the document TrainingAMP.csv

**2.** The validation sequences were deposited in the document Validation.csv

**3.** The test sequences were deposited in the document Non-AMPsfilter.csv

This algorithm demands one-hot code matrix (50×20), word2vec matrix (50×20) and physical/chemical descriptors matrix (91×17) as input.

The one-hot code, Word2Vec, and physicochemical matrix can be calculated by well-annotated codes (line 64-187) in "Train_AMP_identifier2.py" via using the three .csv documents aforementioned. In addition, the files containing pre-calculated physicochemical matrix and Word2Vec parametric file have also been prepared for users (https://pan.baidu.com/s/1pC5JM8GkOSNr36CbwGv3zg with password: 1166), and users don't have to recalculate them again.

Or you can contact author **Sizhe Chen** for these documents if any problems occur during the downloading. We sincerely welcome any email consultation regarding our model, and we would like to provide technical support when necessary (e.g. model deployment, parameters fine-tuning, etc.).

**Notes:**

Some old laptops may struggle to operate AMPLiT because of memory limitations (Intel i7-10875H CPU or better processor is recommended). In addition, you can also copy the codes and run AMPLiT on the Jupyter viewer deployed on the high-performance server (e.g., CPU: Xeon(R) Gold 6430, GPU: RTX 4090, RAM: 120GB).

For any potential questions, please don't hesitate to contact us, and we are willing to provide necessary help. Thank you for your attention.

The model core file is also being prepared and will be uploaded to GitHub soon

**Mathematical Details**

AMPLiT is a deep-learning neural network framework integrated with 3 unique computational blocks.

The framework of the computational block 1 is shown below:
![](block1.png)
The computational block 1 was architected following the fundamental paradigm of multi-head attention mechanisms. We hypothesized that this architecture retained feature recognition capabilities despite reducing computationally intensive convolutional kernels, achieving dual objectives of parameter efficiency and pattern discernment in peptide sequences.

The mathematical principles of the computational block 2 have been illustrated in our previous work [1], with details shown below:
![](block2.png)
The computational block 2 was previously demonstrated to possess performance comparable to that of a nine-layer neural network block, showing improvement to overall model performances.

The framework of the computational block 3 is shown below:
![](block136.png)
The computational block 3, a novel computational module, was mathematically designed in the framework; It dynamically refines informative features while suppressing less useful noises.

Finally, by integration of all 3 computational blocks, our framework was deployed on a consumer-grade laptop (Intel i7-10875H CPU) and achieved high computational efficiency and the maintenance of predictive performance. AMPLiT (Model G) demonstrated remarkable performances (AUPRC: 0.9486±0.0003) parallel to AMPidentifier 1.0, and approximately 80% reduction in training time costs (3200±53 seconds).
