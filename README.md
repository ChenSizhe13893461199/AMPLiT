# AMPidentifier-2.0
This is an updated version of AMPidentifier 1.0 (https://github.com/ChenSizhe13893461199/Fast-AMPs-Discovery-Projects), with a rapid training rate on a normal laptop and overall high overall performances

### The framework of AMPidentifier 2.0:
![](Framework.png)
The source codes of the AMPidentifier 2.0 are available here, with an average **AUPRC indicator of 0.9486±0.0003** and a significantly reduced training time of **3200±53s** on the normal laptop (Intel i7-10875H CPU). Compared to the previous model AMPidentifier 1.0 (**AUPRC: 0.9495±0.0022**, **training time: 15,374±169s**), with overall fitting parameters and time costs decreased by approximately 56% and 80%, respectively. With the introduction of three computational modules, it still showed high overall prediction performance and low false-positive conditions (**Specificity: 90.1347±0.9487%**, **Sensitivity: 99.6864±0.046%**).
